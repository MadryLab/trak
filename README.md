# TRAK: Attributing Model Behavior at Scale

In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14186), we introduce a new data attribution method called `TRAK` (Tracing with the
Randomly-Projected After Kernel). Using `TRAK`, you can make  accurate
counterfactual predictions (e.g., answers to questions of the form â€œwhat would
happen to this prediction if these examples are removed from the training set?").
Computing  data attribution with  TRAK is 2-3 orders of magnitude cheaper than
comparably effective methods, e.g., see our evaluation on:

## Usage

[[quickstart]](https://trak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
[[pre-computed TRAK scores for CIFAR-10]](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Mlpzno97qpI3UC1jpOATXEHPD-lzn9Wg?usp=sharing)

Check [our docs](https://trak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more detailed examples and
tutorials on how to use `TRAK`.  Below, we provide a brief blueprint of using `TRAK`'s API to compute attribution scores.

### Make a `TRAKer` instance

```python
from trak import TRAKer

model, checkpoints = ...
train_loader = ...

traker = TRAKer(model=model, task='image_classification', train_set_size=...)
```

### Compute `TRAK` features on training data

```python
for model_id, checkpoint in enumerate(checkpoints):
  traker.load_checkpoint(ckeckpoint, model_id=model_id)
  for batch in loader_train:
      # batch should be a tuple of inputs and labels
      traker.featurize(batch=batch, ...)
traker.finalize_features()
```

### Compute `TRAK` scores for target examples

```python
targets_loader = ...

for model_id, checkpoint in enumerate(checkpoints):
  traker.start_scoring_checkpoint(ckeckpoint, model_id=model_id, num_targets=...)
  for batch in targets_loader:
    traker.score(batch=batch, ...)

scores = traker.finalize_scores()
```

## Examples
You can find several end-to-end examples in the `examples/` directory.

## Installation

To install the version of our package which contains a fast, custom `CUDA`
kernel for the JL projection step, use
```bash
pip install traker[fast]
```
You will need compatible versions of `gcc` and `CUDA toolkit` to install it. See
the [installation FAQs](https://trak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for tips
regarding this. To install the basic version of our package that requires no
compilation, use
```bash
pip install traker
```
